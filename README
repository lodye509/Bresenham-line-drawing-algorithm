Write a version of the Bresenham line drawing algorithm, or use the one in the book, together with an implementation of its setPixel(x,y) command, to draw lines into your own software RGB color buffer. Create a list of line segments for a line drawing of your name's initials, or some other interesting drawing, use the line drawing algorithm to draw the lines in this list to the color buffer, and then use the OpenGL pixel array calls to copy your RGB color buffer onto the screen. If you want to watch the progress of this algorithm or the ones in the next assignments, you may also implement a version of setPixel that changed only a single pixel of the (single buffered) RGB buffer that is used to refresh the screen.
